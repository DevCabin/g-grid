# g-grid
Fluid responsive grid system, super light weight to replace bootstrap or foundation grid.
Documentation is in the demo.html file in the uncompressed folder.

I got nothing against Foundation or Bootstrap. I have used them both and like them both for their respective strengths. In general however, most web designers have far more original designs than your basic "bootstrap" looking layout. 

Because of this I find that when I include bootstrap I only end up using the grid and some responsive utilities. At the time of this writing bootstrap was between 100k and 200k minified. 

This grid is around 1k minified and has all the same functionality I have been turning to Foundation or Bootstrap for on a regular basis. Just the grid for rapid responsive layouts. 

Also I have removed the need for a "container" class, instead applying the large screen width to the "row" elements. One more talking point is how small my class names are. I went for short but intelligible. Every little bit counts, right? 

Thanks for checking this out. I welcome questions and comments, but know this is in a very 1.0 state. Really it's pre-beta. So be gentle, but please open up if you have something to say.
